# react-crash-course
A react crash course for a beginner

## Create react app using npx (node package executor)
``` npx create-react-app react-basics ```

## Create react app using vite bundler
```
    npm create vite@latest
 
    Scaffolding project in /home/aish/personal-projects/github/react-crash-course/vite-basics...

    Done. Now run:

    cd vite-basics
    npm install
    npm run dev

```

### Vite does not install dependencies or the node_modules folder by default but npx does. Execute ```npm install``` to install the deps
